# tela handoff

Updated: 2026-07-14

## Current milestone

Wave 0 is complete at `209101c`. Wave 1 landed slice by slice: the apply core
loop is `bcba151`, detail metadata is `36ec9f9`, three-tier downloads are
`28fa0b1` + `568e1ef`, persisted per-purity storage settings are `1d8e4de`,
API-key entry is `be7c7d2`, and search + filters are `a3baacd`.

**Wave 1 is complete and smoke-tested on the device.** Apply (home/lock/both),
all three download tiers, a real API key against real Wallhaven, and the
explicit listing all pass on hardware. One item was not exercised: **deep paging
of the Random tab**, so the shuffle seed carried by
`SearchWallpapers.nextPageAfter` has still never survived a real multi-page
Wallhaven response. It is unit-tested; a lost seed would show up only as
repeated images several pages in.

**Wave 2 is now in progress.** Favorites are `0cf2781` and Material You is
`c056369`; see "Wave 2 so far" below.

The app supports the thin product loop:

1. Tap a real Wallhaven tile.
2. Preview the full-resolution image with pinch zoom.
3. Tap **Set wallpaper** and choose Home, Lock, or Both.

The detail screen now starts with the large Wallhaven thumbnail and fades the
full source over it. In parallel, it loads `GET /w/{id}` and renders complete
metadata: resolution, file size/type, category, purity, ratio, colours, tags,
uploader, source, views, and favorites. The apply action remains available
while this request is pending or fails.

The action passes through `ApplyWallpaper` → `WallpaperApplier` → tela's native
Android method channel. Kotlin downloads to app-private cache and calls
`android.app.WallpaperManager`; Both uses sequential home/lock writes separated
by 500 ms for restrictive OEM compatibility.

The detail app bar now also has Download: tap routes to the purity default,
while long-press offers a one-download Gallery / Files, not gallery / Private
library override. `DownloadWallpaper` passes `ImageStore` the ID, source,
purity, and selected `StorageTier`. Its project-owned Android adapter applies
the actual storage policy: SFW/sketchy Gallery downloads are MediaStore images
in `Pictures/tela`; app-private files live below tela's internal files dir; and
the middle tier asks once for a persistent local Storage Access Framework tree,
then writes to `tela/.nomedia` below it. The adapter rejects NSFW before a
MediaStore write can happen.

Download destinations are now a persisted setting rather than a constant.
`StorageSettings` holds one tier for safe/sketchy content and one for explicit
content; `DownloadWallpaper` reads it through the new `SettingsRepository` port
whenever a download arrives without an explicit tier, so the long-press override
is the only thing that can deviate from it. A settings screen off the browse app
bar edits both, writing each change straight through — there is no save button to
lose. Drift is now wired (its first table is the settings key/value store), which
is also the database Wave 2's favorites will land in.

A Wallhaven API key can now be entered, replaced, and removed, from a new account
section at the top of Settings. `SaveApiKey` trims the pasted key, stores it, and
then verifies it; `ForgetApiKey` drops it. The UI holds only *whether* a key
exists, never the key — a saved key cannot be read back out of the app.

Browse is finally a search, not four fixed listings. The app bar holds a search
field, and a filter sheet behind it edits categories, purity, shape (portrait /
landscape / any), sort order, and the toplist range. All of it is one
`SearchQuery` in `browseQueryProvider`, shared by the four tabs; the tab layers
its `Sorting` on top and the screen layers `atLeast`, because neither is a filter
the user chose. **The Explicit purity chip appears only once a key is stored** —
that is the step that was missing for NSFW to be reachable at all, and it is why
the key slice came first.

## Wave 2 so far

**Favorites** (`0cf2781`). Tap the heart on the detail screen to keep a
wallpaper; the browse app bar opens the shelf. `FavoritesRepository` is a
pure-domain port with a Drift adapter, and `ToggleFavorite` returns the state it
landed in so the heart renders from the answer rather than re-reading the store.

**Material You** (`c056369`). `DynamicColorBuilder` feeds the device palette to
`TelaTheme`, which harmonizes it. The seed stays a live path, not a placeholder.

## Decisions made

- `flutter_wallpaper_plus 1.1.1` was evaluated first, as originally locked in
  `PLAN.md`, but its Android Gradle script does not compile with tela's pinned
  AGP 9 toolchain. The failing dependency was removed rather than weakening the
  hermetic build or patching pub-cache state.
- `WallpaperApplier` remains the domain-owned seam. Its current adapter is a
  small project-owned method channel, so a package can still replace it without
  touching features or use cases.
- Native failures map to `WallpaperApplyFailure`; source URLs and platform
  messages never enter the safe domain error.
- The preview decode is capped at twice the physical screen width. Wallpaper
  apply streams the cached source through Android rather than decoding a 6K
  bitmap in Dart.
- The packaged manifest has no storage or media-read permissions.
- `WallpaperDetails` is deliberately separate from the browse `Wallpaper`.
  Its detail fields are non-nullable, so paged grids stay small and detail UI
  cannot turn every field into a null-state branch.
- The NSFW non-indexing rule is now enforced in three places on purpose, each
  closing a different door: `StorageSettings` refuses to *hold* an NSFW→Gallery
  routing (so it cannot be saved), `StorageSettings.choicesFor` is what both the
  settings screen and the one-download override sheet build their options from
  (so it cannot be picked), and the Android adapter still rejects the write (so
  a hand-edited database cannot smuggle it past either).
- Settings persist as key/value rows (`storage.tier.sfw`, `storage.tier.nsfw`)
  rather than a column per setting: a new setting should be a new row, not a
  schema migration. An unreadable, unknown, or forbidden stored value falls back
  to the default instead of throwing — a download must always have somewhere safe
  to go.
- The toolchain image now installs `libsqlite3-dev`. `flutter test` runs Drift on
  the host VM, where `sqlite3_flutter_libs` (which ships the library on Android)
  does not apply, and `dart:ffi` opens the unversioned `libsqlite3.so` that only
  the dev package's symlink provides. Re-run `./tool/tela --build-image` if the
  Drift tests fail to load the library.
- **The API key is verified on save, with an NSFW-purity search** — the open
  question from last session, now closed. That request is the cheapest one
  Wallhaven *must* 401 for a bad key, so it proves the key without adding Wave 2's
  `GET /settings` account endpoint to `WallhavenApi` a wave early. It costs one of
  the 45 req/min, and it means a typo is caught in the dialog rather than three
  screens later as a mystery empty grid.
- `SaveApiKey` writes the key *before* probing, because the key reaches the
  request through `SecretStore` (via `ApiKeyInterceptor`) — there is no way to
  send a key that isn't stored yet. A test with a store-reading fake API pins the
  ordering: probing first would 401 every valid key.
- A rejected key restores the *previous* key rather than leaving the store empty.
  Editing a working key and mistyping it should not cost the user the working key.
- A key that cannot be verified because the device is offline or rate-limited is
  **kept**, and the outcome (`ApiKeySaveOutcome.savedUnverified`) says so in a
  snackbar. Only an actual rejection discards it; being offline says nothing about
  whether a key is good, and forcing a re-paste later would be punishment for it.
- `SearchQuery` now has value equality, and that is load-bearing rather than
  tidiness: the browse grid reloads when its query changes, and every rebuild
  hands it a freshly constructed query. Without element-wise `==` over its sets
  and lists, identical filters would look like a new listing and re-fetch on
  every frame. `WallpaperGrid.didUpdateWidget` is what turns a changed query into
  a reload — a cached page against the old query is a filter that appears ignored.
- The filter sheet edits a **draft** and applies it in one write, unlike the
  settings screen, which deliberately has no save button. The difference is what
  a write costs: a settings write is a local SQLite upsert, while an applied
  filter is a Wallhaven request out of 45/min. Five toggles must not cost five
  listings. Search runs on submit for the same reason — search-as-you-type would
  spend the budget on prefixes of an unfinished word.
- Purity and category are now rendered through `categoryLabel` / `purityLabel` in
  `core/ui`, not `enum.name`. The detail screen had been showing Wallhaven's wire
  values (`sfw`, `general`) straight to the user, which is both untranslatable and
  not language.
- `RatioChoice`, not `Orientation`: Flutter already has an `Orientation` enum, and
  every file with the filter sheet in it imports Material.
- **`~/.android` is now a named volume, and this was a real bug, not tidiness.**
  The toolchain container is `--rm`, so Gradle minted a fresh `debug.keystore`
  on *every* run. A differently signed APK cannot update an installed one
  (`INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`), and `flutter run` resolves that by
  uninstalling first — so every `./tool/tela run` was silently a clean install,
  wiping the Keystore-backed API key and the Drift database. It presented as
  "the key doesn't save". Nothing was wrong with the key code. If a signing
  fingerprint ever changes again, look here first.
- The API key is excluded from Android Auto Backup and device transfer
  (`res/xml/backup_rules.xml`, `res/xml/data_extraction_rules.xml`). The blob is
  encrypted with a Keystore key that no backup carries, so restoring it would
  hand the app a secret it cannot decrypt — corrupt, rather than merely absent.
  Absent is a state tela already handles: it asks for a key. Everything else
  (the database, the download destinations) still backs up.
- The non-gallery tier must use a user-selected SAF directory. An automatic
  raw shared-storage path is not available to a scoped-storage app targeting
  Android 11+ without broader access, and a MediaStore row would violate the
  NSFW non-indexing invariant. Only the local external-storage documents
  provider is accepted, preserving file-manager / USB-MTP reachability.
- **Favorites store the whole wallpaper row, not just its Wallhaven id.** An
  id-only table would need the network to render the favorites grid, and
  offline-readable favorites are the entire reason the feature exists (it is
  PLAN's Wave 2 exit criterion). Every field apply and download need is in the
  row, so a favorite can still be set as a wallpaper in airplane mode.
- **An unrecognised stored purity reads back as `nsfw`, not `sfw`** — the
  deliberate opposite of every other fallback in the codebase, which all fail
  toward the safe default. Purity is what routes a download and gates MediaStore
  indexing, so a corrupt row misread as safe is the one mistake that could index
  an explicit image. Misread as explicit it is merely over-protected.
- Favorites are **local**, and are not Wallhaven's account favorites. Syncing
  those is a different feature and belongs with the `/settings` account slice.
- The v1→v2 migration **adds** a table rather than recreating the database, and
  a test builds a v1 database by hand with raw `sqlite3` to prove the settings
  survive it (drift can only ever create the *current* schema, so nothing else
  exercises the upgrade path a real phone takes). The device carries real
  download destinations; "the app forgot my settings" is the exact failure
  `91cb7b0` spent a session chasing, and it must not come back as a migration
  bug.
- `flutter_staggered_grid_view` became a **direct** dependency. The favorites
  grid is unpaged, so it cannot use `infinite_scroll_pagination`'s
  `PagedMasonryGridView`, and importing a transitive dependency is both a lint
  error and a version-resolution trap.
- A Material You palette whose brightness disagrees with the one requested is
  **refused**, not adapted: a light scheme rendered in dark mode is how you get
  white-on-white text. Quiet-but-wrong beats unreadable. The seed is not dead
  code — Monet is Android 12+ and tela's minSdk is 29.
- `dynamic_color` compiles under the pinned AGP 9 toolchain, which is precisely
  what `flutter_wallpaper_plus` could not do. Both APKs still build.

## Verification

- `./tool/tela dart format .`: clean
- `./tool/tela analyze`: clean
- `./tool/tela test`: 123 tests pass
- Three-tap browse → detail → Both widget flow: covered
- Domain use case and all native target/error mappings: covered
- `/w/{id}` is covered by a detail JSON fixture, mapper boundary tests, and a
  detail widget metadata test
- `./tool/tela build apk --debug`: passes
- `./tool/tela build apk --release`: passes
- Release merged manifest re-inspected after adding Drift: still only `INTERNET`
  and `SET_WALLPAPER`; no `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or `READ_MEDIA_*`
- Download routing has domain/use-case, method-channel, and detail-widget
  coverage; `./tool/tela build apk --debug` compiles the Android storage code
- Storage settings covered at every layer: the domain model (defaults, sketchy
  routing with sfw, both rejections of an indexed NSFW tier), the Drift adapter
  (round-trip, upsert-not-append, unknown value, forbidden value), the use case
  (settings default vs. override), and the settings screen (renders the saved
  tier, persists on tap, withholds the gallery from NSFW)
- `sqlite3_flutter_libs` compiles under the pinned AGP 9 toolchain, which is what
  `flutter_wallpaper_plus` failed to do — both APKs build
- API-key entry is covered at both layers: the use cases (trim, nsfw probe,
  store-before-probe, blank input, rejection with and without a previous key,
  offline and rate-limited both keeping the key) and the settings screen (presence
  without the key itself, save, rejection, removal). One widget test asserts the
  stored key never appears anywhere on screen
- Search + filters: `SearchQuery` equality (same members, any order, and each
  field's change detected), the browse controller (defaults, trimmed term, term
  surviving both an apply and a reset, the last chip refusing to turn off, NSFW
  withheld without a key, ratio round-trip), and the browse screen end to end —
  the Explicit chip is absent with no key, present with one, and applying it
  re-queries at purity `101` rather than leaving the old page up

- Favorites are covered at every layer: the use case (saves an unsaved
  wallpaper, forgets a saved one without re-saving it, round-trips to the state
  it started in, leaves other favorites alone), the Drift adapter (every field
  of the round trip, newest-first ordering, upsert-not-append, forget as a
  no-op, an NSFW favorite surviving as NSFW, and both fail-safe parses), and the
  screens (empty state, a tile per favorite in order, the heart filling and
  emptying, and the grid rendering with no API bound at all)
- The v1→v2 migration is tested against a hand-built v1 database: the settings
  survive and the favorites table appears
- Material You: the device palette is used, a missing one falls back to the
  seed, a wrong-brightness one is refused, and the chrome stays untinted
- `./tool/tela build apk --debug`: passes with `dynamic_color` and the new schema

The Random tab's deep paging is the one Wave 1 behaviour never exercised on
hardware — see below.

## Start of next session

### 1. Wave 2, continued

Three slices remain, in the order they unblock each other:

**Private library** (`FLAG_SECURE` + app-lock). The `appPrivate` tier has been
written to since Wave 1 but there is still no way to *see* what is in it, so
NSFW downloads are currently write-only. This needs a new port method to list
stored images (`ImageStore` can write but not enumerate), `FLAG_SECURE` on the
screen so it cannot be screenshotted or thumbnailed in the app switcher, and an
optional biometric/PIN gate. It is the largest remaining slice and the one that
closes CLAUDE.md's NSFW rules.

**Download history + "set again."** Persist downloads in Drift (the database is
already open and now has two tables), so a wallpaper that is already on the
device can be re-applied without re-fetching it.

**Account `/settings` sync.** `GET /settings` on `WallhavenApi`, pulling the
account's default purity/categories/resolutions. This is also the endpoint that
would give the API key a first-class validity check, if the NSFW probe used by
`SaveApiKey` ever proves too blunt.

Then: the colour filter, and consistent error/empty/offline states across the
grids.

### 2. Still owed on the device

Deep-scroll the **Random** tab. The shuffle seed carries through
`SearchWallpapers.nextPageAfter`, which is unit-tested but has never paged a
real Wallhaven response; a lost seed shows up only as repeated images several
pages in. Everything else in Wave 1 passed on hardware.

Worth a look once the private library lands: confirm on-device that an explicit
download is reachable *in tela* and still absent from Photos.
